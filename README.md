3D Basketball Shot Chart Viewer

Documentation & Guidelines
1. Architecture Layers & Responsibilities
The system is organized into modular layers to ensure clarity, maintainability, and easy collaboration. Each layer has a specific responsibility in the flow of data and presentation of visual content.
1.1. View Layer
Responsibilities:
Displays the UI elements that the user interacts with.
Displays the real-time shot data, including visualizations of shot trajectories and player movements.
Handles user interactions, such as tapping on the court or interacting with the player list.
Key Tasks:
Rendering data: Updates the UI with live data received from the ViewModel layer.
User input: Captures user interactions and triggers corresponding updates in the ViewModel.
1.2. ViewModel Layer
Responsibilities:
Acts as a bridge between the Model (Data Layer) and the View Layer.
Receives live data from the Data Layer, processes it, and exposes it to the View Layer for display.
Handles the business logic related to the data presentation, such as calculating animations, updating UI elements, and reacting to user input.
Key Tasks:
Data transformation: Transforms raw data into a format that the View Layer can use.
Real-time updates: Updates UI elements based on incoming data (e.g., new shot data, player stats).
Error handling: Manages errors, such as issues with live data fetching, and provides fallback options.
1.3. Data Layer (Model)
Responsibilities:
Fetches data from the backend, which may include real-time shot data, player data, and game statistics.
Parses and structures this data into models that can be consumed by the ViewModel layer.
Handles data persistence (e.g., caching) and synchronization with the backend.
Key Tasks:
Network communication: Connects to the backend and fetches live shot data.
Data parsing: Converts raw data (e.g., JSON) into structured data models.
Data caching: Stores data locally to minimize network requests and improve app performance.
1.4. Rendering Layer
Responsibilities:
Renders the visual elements of the basketball court, player models, and shot trajectories.
Utilizes a 3D rendering engine (e.g., SceneKit) to display dynamic content.
Handles camera positioning and scene management for 3D elements.
Key Tasks:
3D rendering: Handles the graphical rendering of the basketball court, players, and shots.
Animation: Manages the animation of shot trajectories, player movements, and other dynamic elements.
Camera control: Adjusts the camera angle and zoom to provide the best view of the action.
1.5. Animation Coordinator
Responsibilities:
Coordinates the animations for moving objects (such as ball trajectories and player movements).
Ensures that animations are smooth, synchronized, and happen in the correct sequence.
Key Tasks:
Shot trajectory animation: Animates the path of a shot from the player's hand to the hoop.
Player movement animation: Coordinates the player movement based on the shot's timing and data.
2. Data Flow and Interaction
The Data Layer (via the LiveShotService) fetches live shot data from the backend and passes it to the ViewModel Layer.
The ViewModel Layer processes the data, formats it for display, and exposes it to the View Layer.
The Rendering Layer receives data from the ViewModel and uses it to render the basketball court, players, and shot trajectories.
The Animation Coordinator ensures that the ball's movement and player animations are synced with real-time data.
3. Performance Considerations & Fallbacks
60fps Rendering: The app is optimized for smooth 60fps rendering by minimizing the number of draw calls, using GPU-friendly textures, and disabling unnecessary physics for static elements (like the basketball court).
Fallbacks for Low-End Devices:
Simplified textures for lower-resolution devices.
Reduced particle effects to minimize GPU load.
Lower animation frame rates (e.g., dropping from 60fps to 30fps) for devices with less graphical power.
Reduced scene complexity by limiting the number of animated or rendered objects for low-end devices.
4. Testing Guidelines
Unit Tests: Implement unit tests to verify the data fetching logic, ViewModel updates, and any utility functions used for animations.
UI Tests: Ensure that the UI components (like the ShotChartView and PlayerListView) update correctly when new data is provided by the ViewModel.
Mock Data: Use mock data to simulate backend responses for testing real-time data handling and UI updates.
5. Developer Guidelines
Code Style:
Follow Swift conventions (e.g., use camelCase for variable names, PascalCase for class names).
Prioritize clear naming for variables, functions, and classes.
Avoid large methods; break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.
Branching Strategy:
Main Branch: Stable code ready for production.
Development Branch: All new features and fixes should be merged here first.
Feature Branches: Create feature-specific branches (e.g., feature/add-shot-animation) for tasks.
Commit Message Format:
Use descriptive commit messages, following this format:
[Feature] Implemented player movement animation
[Fix] Fixed bug in data parsing for shot model
6. Conclusion
This documentation provides an overview of the architecture layers and responsibilities for the Basketball Shot Visualization feature. By organizing the system into clear layers, we ensure that each part of the application has a focused responsibility, making it easier to maintain, extend, and test the app.
